// Create a web app advice gnerator using an api call. 
// Review By John Magpanaty: Dan's app is really neat and well coded, Him and I even shared idea because we did our fetch different ways, the collaboration helped me a lot. His responsiveness is on point, Color scheme fixing and it's near just like the model we're inspired from. Goodjob overall, fix the position of the SVGs. Good job!
